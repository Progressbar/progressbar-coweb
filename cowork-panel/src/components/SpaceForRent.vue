        Our venue is 231 m² in Dunajska 14, at the heart of Bratislava. The space can comfortably accomodate 80 people, but it can be expanded to up to 160 thanks to the bar right below.

        As a non-profit that cares about technology, we try to incentivize tech communities in Bratislava, by allowing them to use the venue for free for their events.
        As a non-profit that needs to pay rent and bills, we also need funding! Any donations are welcome. Without donations, we won't be able too keep the familiar hackerspace spirit a lot of people in Bratislava are seeking, and offer these kinds of services

        Our suggestion is a voluntary donation of 20-60€ for every evening, depending on what you/your community can afford and how much you'll be using the space
        Thanks for the help!
